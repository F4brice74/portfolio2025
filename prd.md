# PRD: Evolutionary Portfolio with Blog Platform

## 1. Product overview
### 1.1 Document title and version
- PRD: Evolutionary Portfolio with Blog Platform
- Version: 1.0

### 1.2 Product summary

This project is an evolutionary portfolio website built with Next.js that will be developed in three progressive phases. The platform will initially serve as a static showcase for personal branding, then evolve into a dynamic blog platform with content management capabilities.

The first phase focuses on rapid deployment of a simple portfolio page with text and images, leveraging existing v0 components. The second phase introduces a blog system with PostgreSQL database integration via NeonDB, enabling article creation, categorization, and filtering. The third phase adds a lightweight back-office with WYSIWYG editing capabilities and Clerk authentication, providing a complete content management solution.
